## Settings

- **Show count of all unread items, not just items in the selected folder**

  When checked, the count added to the title includes _all_ unread items (i.e.
  in all folders) and the count is marked with an asterisk to indicate that it
  includes all folders.

  When unchecked (the default), the count added to the title includes only the
  unread items in the currently-selected folder.

- **Check for unread items everyâ€¦**

  Normally, Feedly only updates the uread counts while the tab is visible. This
  script therefore checks for unread items itself every five minutes (by
  default). This setting allows you to change how often that check occurs. The
  minimum is every one minute, to avoid spamming the servers. The maximum is
  every sixty minutes, which coincides with Feedly's own update schedule.
