## Settings

- **Show count of all unread items, not just items in the selected folder**

  When checked, the count added to the title includes _all_ unread items (i.e.
  in all folders) and the count is marked with an asterisk to indicate that it
  includes all folders.

  When unchecked (the default), the count added to the title includes only the
  unread items in the currently-selected folder.

- **Hide the count when there are no unread items**

  When checked (the default), the unread count will disappear entirely when
  there are no unread items. When unchecked, the unread count will still appear
  (as a zero) when there are no unread items.

- **Check for unread items everyâ€¦**

  Normally, Feedly only updates the uread counts while the tab is visible. This
  script therefore checks for unread items itself every five minutes (by
  default). This setting allows you to change how often that check occurs. The
  minimum is every one minute, to avoid spamming the servers. The maximum is
  every sixty minutes, which coincides with Feedly's own update schedule.

- **Show unread count at the beginning of the title instead of the end**

  When checked, the unread count will be prepended to the beginning of the
  title. When unchecked (the default), it will be appended to the end.
