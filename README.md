This repo contains the user scripts I've written. To learn more about a
particular script, open its documentation from the list below.

## Installation

The extension which manages your user scripts may be able to install them
directly from GitHub, by looking at the "raw" version of the file (via the
Raw button at the top of the file's page). Alternatively, it may be happier
installing them from one of the following common sources of user scripts:

- [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/928949-benblank)
- [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/users/five35/scripts)

## Scripts

- [Feedly](https://feedly.com/)
  - [Unread count in title](scripts/feedly-unread-count-in-title.md)
